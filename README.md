# PythonWeatherCLI

Currently (as of 7/23) only obtains the current hourly temperature.
Uses the ipstack API and therefore to run this on your machine properly you'd need an API Key from that, otherwise all calls don't need any special API Key.

Requests ipify.com, weather.gov, and ipstack.com
Future plans to expand on the hourly + 7-day forecasts, but this is a simple example using api requests to grab current weather for the machine
